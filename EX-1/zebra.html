            Classification and Scientific Name
The Zebra is a large species of equine that is natively found roaming the grassy plains of sub-Saharan Africa.
They are the largest and most distinctive wild horses with bodies that are patterned with white and black stripes,
the exact placement of which is unique to each individual. Three different species of Zebra are found in Africa which are the Common Zebra
(also known as the Plains Zebra and the Burchell’s Zebra), the Grevy’s Zebra (also known as the Imperial Zebra), and the Mountain Zebra.
Zebras are incredibly sociable animals that can travel vast distances in search of fresh grass and water but are severely threatened throughout 
much of their natural range due to increasing levels of human activity. Today, both the Grevy’s Zebra and the Mountain Zebra are considered to be 
endangered species. Although the Common Zebra is more widespread and numerous, there have been sharp population declines in certain areas.

           A zebra stripe is unique to the animal, meaning that no two zebras alike have the same stripes. Their stripes are unique to them as fingerprints 
           are unique to a human. Although to the human eye, these stripes seem the same, these unique stripes help other zebras tell them apart in the wild!
           A zebra can track its family by the pattern type of its stripes. The reason zebras even have stripes in the first place is for thermoregulation. 
           The black stripes absorb heat from the sun and warm up zebras during the early morning, while the white stripes reflect more light and
           help them cool off while they stand and graze in the blazing sun of Africa all day.

            All zebras are native and currently live in Africa, however, the region varies depending on the subspecies. The Grèvys zebra prefers
            semi-arid grasslands and savannah habitats, found only in Ethiopia and primarily in Kenya. The mountain zebra can be found in southwest Africa 
            and prefers dry, stony, and mountainous habitats. The plains zebra has the widest range, residing in east and southern Africa in treeless grasslands 
            and savannahs.

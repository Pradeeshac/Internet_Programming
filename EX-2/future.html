                With the Museum of the Future looking like it’s straight from a sci-fi movie set, driverless taxis on the horizon and Dubai police having Robocops, the city is definitely in the fast lane when it comes to futuristic vibes.

And you’ve been living on another planet if you’ve not heard about about the massive Moon project that could be coming into orbit.

Ever wondered what Dubai in the future will look like? It appears that the sky’s the limit in the UAE spot, prompting plenty of architect firms to unleash their imagination on drawing up concepts that they’d like to take from paper to reality
The UAE is planning to build the first city on Mars and hopes to do so in less than 100 years time as part of the Mars 2117 project. Digital Artist Jyo John Mulloor has put down on paper how he expects it will look. The talented artist has drawn up several images of what he believes the UAE on Mars could be and shared his gallery of pictures on social media. Showing how Downtown Dubai could inspire some parts of UAE on Mars he has included a Down Town Area which shows a range of tall buildings, rivers and vegetation on the Red Planet.

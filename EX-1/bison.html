         This animal's true name is the American bison, but most people call them buffalo.
 Bison are the largest terrestrial animal in North America. They can stand up to six feet (1.8 meters) tall.
 A male can weigh upwards of a ton (900 kilograms), and a female can weigh about 900 pounds (400 kilograms). 
Along with their formidable size, bison have several unique traits that help to identify them. One of the most noticeable is the hump on their shoulders. 
Another characteristic is their deep brown fur, which can grow very long, especially around the face and head. Bison also grow a long beard and mane.
 The head of a bison is very large with a thick skull. Bison fight by crashing their heads or horns together. Both male and female bison have short,
 curved, black horns, which can grow to two feet (0.6 meters) long.

            American bison like to live and travel in groups. For most of the year herds are divided by sex, with females and calves in one herd and males in another herd.
            When the breeding season begins in the summer, many males temporarily join the female herd and begin looking for a mate. Bison communicate by hearing and smell.
            The most important communication is done with pheromones and smells, especially during reproduction. Bison also grunt, snort, and growl.
            The dominant bulls (male bison) choose a female and defend her against other males through fighting. The males might butt heads or use their horns.
            Once the female agrees to mate, the pair mates several times.The cows (female bison) are pregnant throughout the fall, winter, and early spring. The calves are born in mid-spring to increase the likelihood of surviving
            the next winter. The average bison that survives to adulthood can live around 20 years.
            Captive-raised bison typically live longer.
